# BombpartyBot
This bot will automatically play for you. It places words like a human (not instantly) 


For now the bot only support French by default, but if you have an english dict (or any other lanugage) feel free to replace dict.txt with your dictionary (It has to be name dict.txt tho)

**Installation**:

Install python (I used python 3.9 so use that if you want to be sure it'll work)
install selenium (`pip install selenium`)

Put bombparty.py and dict.txt in a folder.

**Usage**:

Get the code of a room in this format: (ABCD)
Enter your username in this formation(multiple letters)
Enter the speed of the bot (5 miliseconds is pretty fast for a human, but possible, I'd use between 7 and 10 for a more realism)

The it should automatically join the first game, but if it doesn't, just join manually, it'll still work. 
I didn't implement the script to automatically join every game cause I was lazy and there's an autojoin button now so press that.

I'm not responsible in anyway if you get banned from a room or the entier game, this script is for educationnal purpose only.

If you have some python knowledge feel free to modify the scirpt as you like, it's not really good anyway. 

Good luck !
